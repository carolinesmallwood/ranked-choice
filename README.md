# Implementation of Ranked Choice Voting Algorithm

Given a set of candidates and a desired sample size, this program generates randomized voting data where each 'voter' ranks between 0 and all of the candidates. Then, given a threshold that a candidate must attain, the program calculates the winner using a ranked choice algorithm.
